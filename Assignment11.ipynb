These tokens are really just indices into a list of the entire vocabulary. Then we convert these integer-tokens into so-called embeddings which are real-valued vectors, whose mapping will be trained along with the neural network, so as to map words with similar meanings to similar embedding-vectors. Then we input these embedding-vectors to a Recurrent Neural Network which can take sequences of arbitrary length as input and output a kind of summary of what it has seen in the input. This output is then squashed using a Sigmoid-function to give us a value between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 is taken to mean a negative sentiment and 1.0 means a positive sentiment. This whole process allows us to classify input-text as either having a negative or positive sentiment.\n",

        "The basic building block in a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a Recurrent Unit (RU). There are many different variants of recurrent units such as the rather clunky LSTM (Long-Short-Term-Memory) and the somewhat simpler GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) which we will use in this tutorial. Experiments in the literature suggest that the LSTM and GRU have roughly similar performance. Even simpler variants also exist and the literature suggests that they may perform even better than both LSTM and GRU, but they are not implemented in Keras which we will use in this tutorial.\n",
        "\n",
        "The following figure shows the abstract idea of a recurrent unit, which has an internal state that is being updated every time the unit receives a new input. This internal state serves as a kind of memory. However, it is not a traditional kind of computer memory which stores bits that are either on or off. Instead the recurrent unit stores floating-point values in its memory-state, which are read and written using matrix-operations so the operations are all differentiable. This means the memory-state can store arbitrary floating-point values (although typically limited between -1.0 and 1.0) and the network can be trained like a normal neural network using Gradient Descent.\n",
        "\n",
        "The new state-value depends on both the old state-value and the current input. For example, if the state-value has memorized that we have recently seen the word \"not\" and the current input is \"good\" then we need to store a new state-value that memorizes \"not good\" which indicates a negative sentiment.\n",
        "\n",
        "The part of the recurrent unit that is responsible for mapping old state-values and inputs to the new state-value is called a gate, but it is really just a type of matrix-operation. There is another gate for calculating the output-values of the recurrent unit. The implementation of these gates vary for different types of recurrent units. This figure merely shows the abstract idea of a recurrent unit. The LSTM has more gates than the GRU but some of them are apparently redundant so they can be omitted.\n",
        "\n",

The same process is repeated for the second layer and this creates a new output sequence which is then input to the third layer's recurrent unit RU3, whose final output is passed to a fully-connected Sigmoid layer that outputs a value between 0.0 (negative sentiment) and 1.0 (positive sentiment).\n",

If the gradient of the recurrent gate is multiplicative, then we essentially have an exponential function.\n",

If a gradient of just 1.01 is multiplied with itself 500 times then it gives a value of about 145. If a gradient of just 0.99 is multiplied with itself 500 times then it gives a value of about 0.007.

This was used to do sentiment analysis of movie reviews from IMDB. It works reasonably well if the hyper-parameters are chosen properly. But it is important to understand that this is not human-like comprehension of text. The system does not have any real understanding of the text. It is just a clever way of doing pattern-recognition."
